Rwanda Now 
	Located in central and east Africa, Rwanda is a sovereign state that is bordered by Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Due to its location of a few degrees below the equator, Rwanda consists of a subtropical climate with two rainy and two dry seasons per year (Rwanda State of Environment and Outlook). Although Rwanda may seem small in size compared to most countries, its geography is rich. Rwanda's geography consists of mountains in the west, savanna in the east, and many lakes throughout the country (Mitchell). Most always the citizens of the United States of America watch the news which only covers local areas or the nation. Sometimes we forget that there are other parts of the world that are suffering. Economics and government concerns aside, Rwanda faces three major environmental problems: destruction of land, lack of resources, and loss of species. 
	Rwanda's number one concern is its destruction of land. As Rwanda's population is growing at a rate of 3.7 percent per year, there is a certain pressure for the people of Rwanda to use more and more of its land for farming, raising livestock, and other agricultural production in order to feed the growing number of people (Rwanda State of Environment and Outlook). This wouldn't be a problem if the lands of Rwanda were reusable and healthy. However, the intensive crop cultivation the people practice is done on land that cannot stand it. In the end, the land is damaged and cannot be used again leaving the Rwandans to use more land that will end up being destroyed (Mitchell). Between 1990 and 2002, the percentage of land used for cultivation has increased from sixty-four percent to seventy-four percent (Rwanda State of Environment and Outlook). Rwandans using more land to produce agriculture has not only destroyed the limited amount of land available but also destroyed the wetlands, increased flooding, destroyed forests, reduced resources, and damaged the natural species. 
	Another environmental concern Rwanda faces is soil erosion. Soil erosion is the washing away of soil by the flow of water. As I mentioned above, Rwandans are pressured to use more of its land for the growing of agriculture. This practice has led to an overall reduction of resources. Overall soil fertility has been reduced because of soil erosion, lack of vegetative cover, and deforestation which are all due to extended land use (Mitchell). Since the farmers have been running out of land, they have ultimately been pushed to farm on slopes. This may not sound like a problem but this type of farming has caused the rainfall to often wash the soil and the crops away. As this farming practice has continued to grow, the percentage of agricultural production has been severely reduced. Today, only 23.4 percent of the country's land is not prone to erosion (Rwanda State of Environment and Outlook).  Ultimately, the Rwandans' food supply has been decreasing and will continue to decrease until they learn how to farm without facing soil erosion.  
	With the help of land destruction and lack of resources, Rwandans face a loss of species as well. As the people are destroying the natural forests in order to produce agriculture, the people are also destroying the homes of many species. The forests consists of a very rich biodiversity and rare animal species. An example of this problem takes place in the Nyungwe National Forest Reserve. This forest was rich with at least 190 species of trees, 275 species of birds, and 12 species of primates (Mitchell). However, due to the Rwandans' use of land, a lot of the number of species has heavily decreased. The hunting and use of land has made the buffalo and almost all of the forest antelopes extinct. In the Nyungwe forest, now there are at most six elephants left (Rwanda State of Environment and Outlook). Although there are restoration policies that are helping the reduction of species, it is still a big concern for Rwandans. 
	I have ordered the following environmental concerns, destruction of land, soil erosion, and loss of species, in the order of importance. Ultimately, the destruction of land has led to all the environmental problems that Rwanda faces. Because Rwandans keep using more land for cultivation, they have started to use sloped land. Farming on sloped land leads to soil erosion because with gravity, the rain washes down the soil and crops with it. Because of soil erosion and its reduction in resources, the people of Rwanda began to destroy the forests for more soil. In this process, the homes of many species and the overall biodiversity has been reduced significantly as well (Thaxton). As one thing has led to another, I have ranked the environmental concerns as so. 
	Although these environmental concerns have had huge detrimental effects on Rwanda, there is still hope. Slowly but surely, Rwanda is using information technology in order to help make an improved country of Rwanda. Since a few years ago, Rwanda has completed a nationwide 2,300 kilometer fiber-optic cable. This network allows Rwanda to connect with the outside world by means of the Seacom undersea cable along the east coast of Africa. Basically, this means that Rwanda now has access to fast Internet access along with a wide range of broadband services. Moreover, Rwandans now enjoy the convenience of mobile phones with Internet on it as well. This type of information technology changes not only destruction of land but also other environmental concerns. Now, with this type of information technology, the people of Rwanda can significantly reduce the destruction of land. One might ask how is this type of technology going to change the lives of Rwandans? But, the answer is that it'll change the lives significantly. 
	With the addition of the ever great Internet and mobile phones, all the systems have changed. The country of Rwanda will be able to see less land destructed because of the usage of phones. Just like us Americans have smart phones that have applications where we can control a lot about our lifestyles, the Rwandans are slowly adjusting their lifestyles as well. Farmers can receive updates on the market prices for their crops, with an SMS software program called e-Soko. This allows middlemen to be dropped, leading Rwandan farmers to more profit. Although this may not seem like a big deal, little by little, improvements like this will help reduce the necessity for farmers to keep overuse the amount of land that is needed (Tafirenyika). Along with applications that allow farmers to see what is the needed output, the mobility and access to Internet will heavily educate the people of Rwanda (Kariuki). In time, with education, will come everything else.
	These days, information is now a resource that has no ends while the environmental resource has a limit. “Technology is accelerating the use of sustainability as a driver of growth, particularly information technology, as it allows greater monitoring, independent verification, transparency, and accuracy of resource usage and its impact” (Kariuki). As Rwandans are using information technology more each day to their advantage, they are becoming better at managing the limited amount of resources they own.  As long as Rwandans continue to embed sustainability in operations, they will be able to provide information so that they may make sustainable choices and behaviors (Tafirenyika). Through the process of promoting awareness of the scarce resources, simple things such as reducing printing and paper usage has helped the environmental concerns of Rwanda such as destruction of land (Kariuki). 
	Although there haven't been ground breaking improvement in the influence of information technology on the top three environmental concerns of Rwanda, we hope to see changes, little by little, leading to a greater and safer place.
